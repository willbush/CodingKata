Zombie Bird Kilobolt tutorial http://www.kilobolt.com/zombie-bird-tutorial-flappy-bird-remake.html

I finished this tutorial and learned a lot in the process. I decided against modifying the game to make "my own" flappy bird clone since there are already tons of flappy bird clones out there already. The code here is similar to the tutorial but I did refactor a bunch of it. I'm also using a newer version of LibGDX, which does not support openGL 1.0 which the tutorial uses. The end result is similar to Jame's game, which you can play here: http://jamescho7.com/zombiebird/
