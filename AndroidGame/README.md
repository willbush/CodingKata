Porting kilobolt game to Android.

I've completed this kilobolt tutorial and probably will not be working on developing it further since I rather work with the libGDX framework.

The game framework used here is created by Mario Zechner and covered uner Apache license 2.0. I included a copy of the license in the top directory.
